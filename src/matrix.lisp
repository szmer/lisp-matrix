;;;; This is a rewrite of the matrix class interface, in order to
;;;; allow both foreign arrays and lisp arrays as underlying
;;;; implementation, ideally in a simultaneous fashion.
;;;;
;;;; * The base MATRIX-LIKE class
;;;; 
;;;; We will begin by defining what is a matrix, without assuming
;;;; anything about the underlying implementation.
;;;;
;;;; We define the abstract matrix class, and some conditions
;;;; satisfied by its slots are checked at initialization.
;;;; Conceptually, a matrix is just a table with a certain number of
;;;; rows and columns.  We define a generic function DATA that will
;;;; return the underlying data of the matrix, but leave it to be
;;;; defined in the implementation classes.
;;;;
;;;; We define generic functions for the slot readers in order to
;;;; provide them documentation and make more explicit the fact that
;;;; they will be shared for other functions as well.
;;;;
;;;; Note that we leave all error checking of class instanciation to
;;;; the functions that create such matrices.  (see the section
;;;; "Creating Matrices")

;;; Tony's guidance for this file:  basic generics and "virtual"
;;; classes for supporting matrix work.  All the hard guts are found
;;; in the implementations and subsets.  But the cool soft guts are
;;; here, and as much as possible on a virtual level is done.

;;; So object instantiation, access, special common objects (random,
;;; identity matrices) go here.   But numerical methods do not.

;;;; * Creating matrices

;;;; several implementations of matrices.  The two that come to mind
;;;; are :LISP-ARRAY (matrices based on lisp arrays) and
;;;; :FOREIGN-ARRAY (matrices based on foreign arrays allocated
;;;; through FFI).

;;; Tony notes: Modification of above from Mark and Evan's initial
;;; work -- we now consider the POTENTIAL use of integrating Tamas
;;; Papp's work with foriegn-friendly-arrays (ffa package) here, as a
;;; more mature starting basis -- after all, it was created based on
;;; discussions held during the/before/after this package
;;; development.
;;;
;;; Likewise, :FOREIGN-ARRAY is related to Rif's work.  Also part of
;;; the general strategy of allowing for multiple implementations to
;;; be useable, for internal benchmarking as well as for external
;;; (usable) flexibility.

;;;; ** Simple matrices

;;; Copying is one of the most critical activities, since it provides
;;; efficiency and correctness if done right.  We want to deep copy
;;; for correctness, and simply pass-through without copy for
;;; algorithm speed.

;;; COPY   - Return a deep identical copy of MATRIX (same implementation
;;;          and element-type).  (function)
;;;
;;; COPY*  - Same as COPY but specify the implementation.
;;;
;;; COPY!  - Copy A into B if they are not the same object, and return
;;;          B.  A and B should be matrices or vectors with the same
;;;          dimensions, but not necessarily of the same
;;;          implementation.     (generic function)
;;;
;;; COPY-MAYBE  - Return a deep copy of MATRIX if TEST is satisfied, or
;;;               return MATRIX itself.  TEST is a function of one
;;;               argument that will be applied to MATRIX.
;;;
;;; COPY-MAYBE* - like COPY-MAYBE but the implementation of the
;;;               returned copy is specificed a deep copy of MATRIX if
;;;               TEST is satisfied, or return MATRIX itself.  TEST is
;;;               a function of one argument that will be applied to
;;;               MATRIX.
